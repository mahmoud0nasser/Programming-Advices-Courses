# Programming Advices Courses - Repository Overview

Welcome to my **Programming Advices** course repository! This repository documents my journey through 13 foundational courses in programming, problem-solving, and object-oriented programming (OOP). Each course builds upon the previous, enhancing my skills in programming fundamentals, algorithms, data structures, and software design.

## ðŸ“š Course List and Descriptions

### 01. Programming Foundations - Level 1
An introduction to programming fundamentals, including basic syntax, data types, operators, and flow control structures. This course lays the groundwork for understanding programming concepts.

### 02. Algorithms & Problem-Solving - Level 1
Focuses on problem-solving techniques and foundational algorithms, teaching how to break problems into smaller, manageable parts.

### 03. Programming Using C++ - Level 1
Covers the basics of programming in C++, including input/output, variables, and control structures. Hands-on coding practice is emphasized.

### 04. Algorithms & Problem-Solving - Level 1 Solutions
Provides step-by-step solutions for problems discussed in "Algorithms & Problem-Solving Level 1," reinforcing techniques with practical examples.

### 05. Algorithms & Problem-Solving - Level 2
Builds on the basics by introducing more complex algorithmic concepts and problem-solving strategies, such as recursion and backtracking.

### 06. Introduction to Programming Using C++ - Level 2
Explores intermediate concepts in C++, such as functions, arrays, and pointers. This course focuses on structuring and organizing code for better readability and maintainability.

### 07. Algorithms & Problem-Solving - Level 3
Introduces advanced problem-solving techniques, focusing on greedy algorithms, divide-and-conquer strategies, and dynamic programming.

### 08. Algorithms & Problem-Solving - Level 4
Delves into optimization problems, graph theory (DFS, BFS), and real-world applications of algorithmic thinking.

### 09. Foundations Level 2
Expands foundational programming concepts, including file handling, debugging, and error-handling techniques, preparing for more complex projects.

### 10. OOP as it Should Be (Concepts)
Introduces Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, focusing on theory and design.

### 11. OOP as it Should Be (Applications)
Covers the practical implementation of OOP concepts in real-world projects, exploring class design, relationships, and design patterns.

### 12. Data Structures - Level 1
An introduction to essential data structures, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and their applications in solving computational problems.

### 13. Algorithms & Problem-Solving - Level 5
The final course in the series, covering advanced algorithms like graph algorithms (shortest path, minimum spanning tree) and exploring NP-complete problems.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals and Learning Outcomes

By completing these courses, I have:

- Developed strong problem-solving skills.
- Built a solid foundation in C++ programming.
- Learned and applied OOP principles effectively.
- Gained knowledge of fundamental data structures and algorithms.
- Acquired the ability to approach and solve advanced programming challenges.
